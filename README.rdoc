= Headingify

A method used to convert a string into a heading. It extends the String class; currently only supporting the English language. Please contribute if you are adept in other languages utilizing articles, conjuctions, and prepositions.

Headingify is based off of grammatical rules set forth in _The Chicago Manual of Style. ed. 16 pgf. 8.155_.

== Download and Installation

The latest version of Headingify can be installed with RubyGems:
  
  % [sudo] gem install headingify

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

  gem 'headingify'
    
== Usage

To execute in standalone mode do the following:
  
  % headingify "a simple string, including the preposition 'with'."
    > A Simple String, including the Preposition 'with'.

To escape words in a string do the following:
  
  % headingify "folding of the \%CheY\% protein."
    > Folding of the CheY Protein.
